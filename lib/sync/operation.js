/**
  Note: This file is implemented in an extremely naÃ¯ve way. At the moment,
  it simply iterates through operations to find transformable or composable
  operations, and sync/reference simply replays the operations every time
  a snapshot is requested.

  Once the semantics are clearly defined, this should be changed to use
  a more optimized path for each operation (e.g. we could implement
  the composition of all SetProperty operations as a dictionary of
  property->op).
